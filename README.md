# ECDSA Implementation is RUST
--------------------------------

This library provides an implementation of the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) in Rust. It allows you to:

- Generate ECDSA keypairs (private and public keys)
- Sign messages using a private key
- Verify signatures using a public key
